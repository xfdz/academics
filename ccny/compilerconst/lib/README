HOW TO RUN:

To run the limited pascal compiler you'll need perl 5.8 or greater. 
I only use standard modules, so downloading a library isn't necessary.

To execute the compiler, change directories into /lib 

 ./jpcc.pl test/test_write_and_writeln.pas


OPTIONAL FLAG:

I have an option flag called "-dump" that you can pass as an extra option tojpcc.pl. It will do a pretty print of internal data structures being used bythe objects.

./jpcc.pl test/test_write_and_writeln.pas -dump
